# Hooked State

A lightweight lib that provides React state management using simply hooks!

## Motivation
If you are already familiar with [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html), you may have already tried to replace Redux for state management with just [useReducer](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usereducer) and [useContext](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usecontext). In fact, it's possible. See [State Management with React Hooks and Context API in 10 lines of code!](https://medium.com/simply/state-management-with-react-hooks-and-context-api-at-10-lines-of-code-baf6be8302c). You can perfectly code your own state management setup using hooks from scratch. However, it's always a good idea to reduce as much boilerplate as you can. Therefore, the motivation for building this lib is to have a set of functions that one does not need to worry about repetitive logic and verbose setup.

## Installation
```sh
npm i hooked-state
```
